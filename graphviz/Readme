## What is this?

a ruby dsl for generating value flow dot files, created for the Amsterdam pilot in the Reflow project.

## How does it work?

for an example see zorgschorten.rb
execute with 
$ ruby zorgschorten.rb

this will output graphviz commands to stdout
you can paste them online in "https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline" to generate a graph
(or just use graphviz if you have it installed)
