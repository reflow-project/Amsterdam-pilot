## Experiment 
This is an experiment syncing the actual swapshop inventory levels with an economic resource in reflow os.

## Assumptions regarding the Reflow OS instance

A local instance of reflow os is running locally on port 4009 
(```$ make dev``` in zenpub directory)

The reflow os is seeded with at least the following:
- A user representing the swap shop (register and validate)
- A unit that is used for the inventory level (see Api Tour, 'create Unit')
- An economic resource that represents the swap shop (see Api Tour, 'create Economic resource through Event')
For the experiment these were made by hand with the graphiql interface

A valid .env file in the experiments directory contains the credentials to log in with the user representing the swap shop

## Assumptions regarding the Lightspeed client
A  valid .env file in the experiments directory contains the credentials to refresh the token of the swap shop employee user

## To run
$ ruby reflow_adapter.rb 

It will connect to lightspeed, download and process the entire inventory, reduce it to a single total number, and sync this total number with the 'onhand' value of the economic resource that was created in reflow os.
You should see something like the output below..
